# geomap-angular - Integrating Google's geomap visualization into an angularjs project.

This project is based on the angular-seed project.
So far it doesn't do much as mostly it is for exploring.

## How to use geomap-angular

Clone the geomap-angular repository and start hacking...


### Running the app during development

You can pick one of these options:

* serve this repository with your webserver
* install node.js and run `scripts/web-server.js`

Then navigate your browser to `http://localhost:<port>/app/index.html` to see the app running in
your browser.


### Running the app in production

This really depends on how complex is your app and the overall infrastructure of your system, but
the general rule is that all you need in production are all the files under the `app/` directory.
Everything else should be omitted.

Angular apps are really just a bunch of static html, css and js files that just need to be hosted
somewhere, where they can be accessed by browsers.

If your Angular app is talking to the backend server via xhr or other means, you need to figure
out what is the best way to host the static files to comply with the same origin policy if
applicable. Usually this is done by hosting the files by the backend server or through
reverse-proxying the backend server(s) and a webserver(s).


### Running unit tests

We recommend using [jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) and
[Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io) for your unit tests/specs, but you are free
to use whatever works for you.

Requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), Karma (`sudo npm install -g karma`) and a local
or remote browser.

* start `scripts/test.sh` (on windows: `scripts\test.bat`)
  * a browser will start and connect to the Karma server (Chrome is default browser, others can be captured by loading the same url as the one in Chrome or by changing the `config/karma.conf.js` file)
* to run or re-run tests just change any of your source or test javascript files


### End to end testing

Angular ships with a baked-in end-to-end test runner that understands angular, your app and allows
you to write your tests with jasmine-like BDD syntax.

Requires a webserver, node.js + `./scripts/web-server.js` or your backend server that hosts the angular static files.

Check out the
[end-to-end runner's documentation](http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/dev_guide.e2e-testing) for more
info.

* create your end-to-end tests in `test/e2e/scenarios.js`
* serve your project directory with your http/backend server or node.js + `scripts/web-server.js`
* to run do one of:
  * open `http://localhost:port/test/e2e/runner.html` in your browser
  * run the tests from console with [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io) via
    `scripts/e2e-test.sh` or `script/e2e-test.bat`


### Receiving updates from upstream

When we upgrade angular-seed's repo with newer angular or testing library code, you can just
fetch the changes and merge them into your project with git.
